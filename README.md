# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of analysis:

The purpose of this assignment is to help the company Pewlett-Hackard prepare for the 'silver tsunami' as many current employees are reaching retirement age. I'll be helping by determining the number of retiring employees per title and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:

  1. Creating Retirement Titles table.
   
      - The table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

  2. Creating Unique Titles table.
  
      - An updated version of the retirement table but with a 'DISTINCT ON' statement that would only contain the most recent title of each employee & exlude those employees that have already left the company.

  3. Creating Retiring Titles table.
  
      - A table that shows the amount of retirement-age employees of each department title.

  4. Creating Mentoring Eligibility table.
  
      - With this table it holds the employees that are eligible to participate in the mentoring program by the specific birth year of 1965.

## Summary:

The impact of retiring employees will be enourmous because in total the amount retiring is 41,380.

The table below shows the count of titles from the mentoring eligibility table.

When this table is compared to the retiring tables it really shows the disparity of the amount of people retiring fully and the small amount the company wants to use to train the future employees. I would find it hard for the company if this was their only option in resolving this "silver tsunami".
